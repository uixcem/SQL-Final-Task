# My Historical Dictators Database Project

This is my database project where I collected information about historical dictators. I got interested in this topic after seeing diktaattoriporssi.com, and I decided to create a SQL database to practice what I learned in our database course. Why did I choose this topic? Because I am also a victim of one of the dictators in my country, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. I was imprisoned for 9 months when I was a law student, charged with participating in the July 15, 2016 coup attempt against their government (as a student??). That's why I think your website is very important to show dictators to the world, and it has a special meaning to me.

## What I Did

I created a database with two main tables:

- A table for countries (with regions)
- A table for dictators with their basic information

While researching, I found lots of interesting data about different dictators throughout history. I grouped them by regions to make it easier to analyze patterns in different parts of the world.

## How To Use My Project

If you want to try this yourself:

1. First create a new database
2. Run the CREATE TABLE statements
3. Run the INSERT statements to add the data
4. Try out the example queries
5. Feel free to modify the queries to find different information

## Notes About My Project

- I collected this data from your website diktaattoriporssi.com
- I grouped them by regions to make it easier to understand
- I included both historical and current rulers
- I kept the structure simple to focus on what we learned in class, at least what I learned.

This was a really interesting project for me to practice SQL. I learned a lot about different dictators and their countries. I hope you find it interesting too!

## Sources

- I used diktaattoriporssi.com as my main source for the data. This helped me create a comprehensive list of historical and current dictators.
- I used a Claude.ai for the getting data from the website. I also used Claude.ai for things that I stuck on the project.
